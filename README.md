tech doesn't change the world,
people using it do

making tech research accessible for people to use is far more important than the research itself, because true research lies in making something useful for people who need it most, not in profiting from their needs

Tueely works by connecting those who need tech research with those who can provide it, while fairly rewarding researchers, ensuring that all research, whether for investors or general innovation, creates value for everyone to benefit from
